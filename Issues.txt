I had to disable the trainController UI. 
The issue seems to be binded to the dummy trains that Chi added to the track model. ( Line 56 and 57 of TrainModuleUI)
Running out of a vector list or something this is for Jacob to investigate.
Had to comment out lines 91 and 94 of the code to get it to work.

Do we want the yard to have a list of trains? Or should that be information known by the trainModule?

put information known by the trackModule
